<p>
We are a parish in the East of England Deanery of the Diocese of Sourozh - the diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church which covers the British Isles. Our parish was founded in 1973 by Metropolitan Anthony of Sourozh. Since December 2000, we have been worshipping in the Chapel of Westcott House, in Jesus Lane, Cambridge, during which time our parish has grown steadily in numbers.
<br><br>
Our parishioners come from many countries - the UK, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Germany, Poland, Greece, Cyprus, Egypt, Switzerland, Hungary, Serbia, Australia, Canada and the USA, to name just some â€“ and from many walks of life. Some have had a life in the Orthodox Church in their home country, while others have rediscovered that life here.
<br><br>
Still others have discovered Orthodoxy here and been received into the Church by either Baptism or Chrismation. Although we do use some Church Slavonic in our services they are, for the most part, celebrated in English, the lingua franca of the parish.
