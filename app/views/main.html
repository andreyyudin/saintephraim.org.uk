        As from <b>Saturday 22 September 2018</b>, our services will be held in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/EqJMCdvAmTK2">St Clement's Church in Bridge Street, Cambridge</a>.

        <h4>The agreement with St Clement’s</h4>
        As most of you will be aware, we were negotiating for a considerable time with the Parochial Church Council of St Clement's Church in Bridge Street to be allowed to worship there. The terms of a Licence Agreement were agreed between our two parishes in November 2017 but approval of the Licence had then to be sought from the Anglican Diocese of Ely. Once this was received, the Licence Agreement was signed between our two parishes in March 2018. The agreement envisages us worshipping at St Clement's for at least the next 20 years and provides a long term home for our St Ephraim's Orthodox Parish.
        <h4>Building and other works</h4>
        There have been delays to the commencement of various building works in St Clement's, including the installation of toilets, a kitchen area and a lift for disabled access. These works are to the benefit of both parishes. It had been intended that the work would be completed this summer and, on this basis, the decision was taken that we would begin to worship in St Clement's on the weekend of 22/23 September. Although the delays mean that the work will not now be completed until early December, our Parish Council have decided that we should  - if at all possible - keep to our original move date since, we are told, enough of the work will have been completed to make it possible for us to use St Clement's Church by 22/23 September. The remainder of the work does not, in any case, affect the 'people's part' of the church. It should also be noted that building works will be taking place at Westcott from January, 2019. Indeed, some preparatory work has already started.
        <br><br>
        Works are also being carried out specific to Orthodox worship. We have commissioned an iconostasis. This is made of wrought iron, since it will need to be moved back against the walls of the chancel of the church between our services and those of St Clement’s.  The icons are being painted by Aidan Hart, the leading iconographer in the UK. The iconostasis is already under construction and should be installed in early December 2018.
        <br><br>
        A number of pews are being removed from the church and the remainder, in the body of the church, will be made moveable thus making St Clement's more suitable for Orthodox worship.
        <br><br>
        We are also building a number of storage cupboards for St Clement’s so that all our materials can be stored on site in one place. Other materials have also been ordered, though these are unlikely to be available/installed by the time we move (for example, 6 icons for the pillars, new candle stands and Golgotha).

        <h4>Use of St Clements</h4>
        We shall have exclusive use of St Clement's <b><em>from 15.30 each Saturday until 10.00 on Sunday</em></b>. Great Vespers or Vigil will continue to be served each Saturday at 17.00 as now but, as agreed at two Parish Meetings, <b><em>the Divine Liturgy will now begin at 08.00 on Sundays, starting on 23 September</em></b>.
        <h4>The move</h4>
        We have already cleared out a lot of surplus equipment and materials prior to the move.  We will be moving over to St Clement’s in September and shall need help in moving various items both from Westcott House and from our storage facility in Coldhams Lane. If you are able to help with this, please contact Vladmir Kiselev, our Chuchwarden (<a href="mailto:vladimir.yu.kiselev@gmail.com">vladimir.yu.kiselev@gmail.com</a>).
        <h4>Set up/take down</h4>
        There will be a certain amount of setting up on Saturday afternoons (including moving the pews from the body of the church) but not as extensive or complicated as at present. We shall also need to clear away each Sunday after the Divine Liturgy and help our friends at St Clement's return the pews to their place in time for their Sung Mass at 11.00.
        <h4>Working together with St Clement’s</h4>
        The agreement between our two parishes sees the need for goodwill and forbearance on both sides.  There will be an inevitable period of 'settling in' with the new arrangement, and both parishes will need to cope with the disruption of ongoing building works after this first phase is completed (for example, further roof repairs). Let us, for our part, act with good grace and do all we can to ensure that things take place as smoothly as possible, each week. Again we shall need your help with this.
        <br><br>
        When this first phase of the building work is completed, we hope to have coffee together each Sunday, once things are cleared away after the Divine Liturgy, until 10.50.
