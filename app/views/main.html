    <h2>COVID-19 (Coronavirus)</h2>
    Dear brothers and sisters,
    <br><br>
    Late last night, Bishop Matthew of Sourozh issued a decree stating that, in view of the government restrictions, the clergy aged 70 and above - which includes me - must temporarily refrain from serving in the parishes entrusted to them.
    <br><br>
    In view of this, and until I can establish what exactly the bishop will allow me to do - such as serving the Divine Liturgy at home etc - all public services in our parish, including Reader's services are hereby CANCELLED.
    <br><br>
    I will write to you again s soon as I am in a position to do so.
    <br><br>
    In the meantime let us pray fervently for one another, for all those suffering form this dreadful virus and for all those working to relieve those afflicted. May the Lord God deliver His world from this plague.
    <br><br>
    With my love in Christ,
    <br>
    Fr Raphael
