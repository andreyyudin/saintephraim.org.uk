    <h2>COVID-19 (Coronavirus)</h2>
    Dear brothers and sisters,
    <br><br>
    Please find the <a href="docs/Bishop-Matthew-eng.pdf">English</a> and <a href="docs/Bishop-Matthew-rus.pdf">Russian</a> versions of a Statement issued by His Grace Bishop Matthew of Sourozh, about the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) outbreak. Please also find the message of His Grace Metropolitan Anthony of Korsun and Western Europe in <a href="docs/Metropolitan-Anthony-eng.pdf">English</a> and in <a href="docs/Metropolitan-Anthony-rus.pdf">Russian</a>.
    <br><br>
    In view of the  Bishop’s and Metropolitan's recommendations:
    <br><br>
    1. Until further notice, individual confessions before services are suspended. Instead they will now be replaced by a rite of General Confession each Saturday evening, immediately after Vespers or Vigil.  For the moment, General Confession will be the norm in the parish. Those who feel the need for individual confession, should discuss this with me, with a view to meeting at some point during the week, at the Church. 
    <br><br>
    2. We shall have individual paper cups available by the weekend for use with the ‘zapifka’ following reception of Holy Communion.  
    <br><br>
    3. Parents are encouraged to bring a snack for their children to eat after the service but, with immediate effect, there will be no coffee or other refreshments served after the Divine Liturgy on Sunday
    <br><br>
    4. We must continue in fervent prayer for all those who are suffering from the Coronavirus and for the pandemic to come to an early end.
    <br><br>
    With my love in Christ,
    <br>
    Fr Raphael
