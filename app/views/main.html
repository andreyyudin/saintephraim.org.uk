    <h3 class="alert-heading">Service Booking</h3>
    <p>
        Due to restrictions inside the church building, we are now holding services with a reduced number of participants. No more than 30 households will be allowed to attend one service. Therefore there will be 30 slots available for booking. 
        <br><br>
        Taking into account the number of our parishioners, the services available should enable everyone to attend the Divine Liturgy at least once every two weeks. So please be mindful of this when making a booking. 
        <br><br>
        Once your booking is made you will receive a confirmation e-mail and your name will be added on the list of participants for the desired service. You will only be allowed to enter the church if you have booked and your name, followed by the exact number of attendants from your household will be on the steward's list. The booking system manager will ensure that the total number of bookings for a service doesn't exceed the limit. Therefore, if you happen to overbook, your extra bookings (i.e. second Divine Liturgy of the same week) will be canceled and you will be notified of this via e-mail. If your booking is canceled, you won't be allowed to attend that specific service.
        <br><br>
        Please also read the following documents:

        </ul>
        <br>
        If you wish to submit a prayer request with a list of names to be remembered in the Divine Liturgy, please send an e-mail with no more than 20 names (Orthodox living + departed) and the Divine Liturgy date you wish the names to be remembered on to the following e-mail address: <a href="mailto:prayer.requests@saintephraim.org.uk" class="alert-link" target="_blank">prayer.requests@saintephraim.org.uk</a>

        During that time we shall stream our services, via Zoom. Services will be streamed from St Clementâ€™s, at the times shown on the website, but behind closed doors.

        <br><br>
