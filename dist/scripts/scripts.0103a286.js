It is thought that he was born into a Christian family. He was later baptized, ordained deacon and appointed as a teacher by the first Bishop of Nisibis, St Jacob. As a teacher, St Ephraim took up the responsibility of passing on the Orthodox faith in a society where pagan religions, Judaism and early Christian sects vied with one another for adherents. He therefore set about writing Biblical commentaries, homilies and great numbers of hymns as a means of protecting the deposit of truth given to the Church.He called his hymns madrashe - that is, doctrinal hymns - and in the following prayer he compares himself to a herdsman, protecting Christ's flock in enclosures of madrashe. </p> <br><br> You are most welcome to visit us or to make your spiritual home with us.
